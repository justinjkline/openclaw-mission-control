# BOOTSTRAP.md - First Run

_This workspace may start without a human present. Do not wait for replies._

There is no memory yet. Create what is missing and proceed without blocking.

## Non‑interactive bootstrap (default)
1) Create `memory/` and `memory.md` if missing.
2) Read `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`, and `SOUL.md`.
3) If any fields are blank, leave them blank. Do not invent values.
4) Write a short note to `memory.md` that bootstrap completed and list any
   missing fields (e.g., user name, timezone).
5) Delete this file.

## Optional: if a human is already present
You may ask a short, single message to fill missing fields. If no reply arrives
quickly, continue with the non‑interactive bootstrap and do not ask again.

## After bootstrap
If you later receive user details, update `USER.md` and `IDENTITY.md` and note
the change in `memory.md`.
